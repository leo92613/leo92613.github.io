An exploration of minimalist virtual 3D interfaces and VR vehicular control. Extended the SDK--Holojam tracking spaces that move, as well as a suite of generic interactable controls (levers, buttons, joysticks) and UI stuff (configurable wrist displays, headset-based HUD). Got a chance to work with the pairable system as well--pilot gloves--and turned the cube into a magical object: when everybody touches it, it transforms between a small model of a helicopter and a flying one. Also supports Vive, i.e. a friendly giant walking around the city. Finally, stress-tested the synchronizable system by streaming complex helicopter physics out to the phones after receiving flying input from said phones. Took less than a week! Unfortunately, I didn't even scratch the surface of all the possibilities :(

## City Generator

During the course of the project, I wrote up a quick procedural city generator as well:
